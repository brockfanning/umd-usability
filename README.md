# How to make your app unusable

## for Dynamic Web Applications - UMD

This is a simple app with three example pages. The two branches in the repo, usable and unusable, represent different versions of the app.

To see what's different in code:

```
git diff usable unusable
```

To run the app locally, I recommend using something like the [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) npm package.
